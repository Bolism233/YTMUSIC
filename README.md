## How it works:
1. Takes Playlist URL
2. Get songs in the playlist
3. Get song name and artist by splitting song Name - Artist
    Limitations: 
        1. Only recognize format: {Artist} - {Song Name} 
        2. Can only recognize songs in lastfm database
4. Obtain the song label/category from lastfm.api?

## Next Step:
**optimize request code to reduce repetition**
**Get genre/label of the music from 'track'**
**Find similar music**
